# About Testing

 # POINT - 1
 # -------------------
 # After Development is done then
 # we need to test our software and release the code to client
 # -------------------

 # POINT - 2
 # -------------------
 # There will be a separate development team
 # and
 # separate testing team
 # -------------------

 # POINT - 3
 # -------------------
 # There are many types of testing
 # Like
 # 1) unittesting
 # 2) Integration testing
 # 3) System testing
 # Many more
 # Refer : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing

 # POINT - 4
 # -------------------
 # In our case, we are discussing on unittesting
 #
 # How to use python to test our software
 #
 # We have few libraries for unitesting like unittest, pytest, etc.
 #
 # Here we are discussing about pytest
 #
 # In unitesting / in Pytest
 # - each 'test' we called as 'test case'
 # - In pytest, We are defining each test case inside each function
 #   Ex: 10 tests Means 10 Test cases and it will 10 functions
 # - test each test case result using assert statements
 #   because pytest framework will expect AssertionError for
 #   failed test case
