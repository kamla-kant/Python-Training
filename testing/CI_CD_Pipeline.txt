# Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery

 POINT-1 :
 #--------------------------
 # - Development Team:
 #       -- Develop and release for testing team
 # - Testing Team :
 #       -- If they are busy they will take our project later
 #           else they will take immidietly
 #       IF THEY ARE BUSY THEN DELAY IN TESTING
 #       IF ANY ISSUE THEY WILL REPORT BACK TO DEVELOPMENT TEAM
 # - Development Team:
 #       -- If they are busy they will take our project later
 #           else they will take immidietly
 #       IF THEY ARE BUSY THEN DELAY IN FIXING ISSUE
 #       IF ISSUE IS FIXED THEN THEY WILL RELEASE FOR TESTING
 # This will continues till all the issues getting fixed
 #
 # FINALLY SOME GOOD DAY THEY WILL RELEASE
 #
 #--------------------------
 # OBSERVATIONS : DELAY, USING MORE RESOURCE
 #--------------------------


 #--------------------------
 # SOME HOW WE WANTED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
 # SOLVED : INTRODUCING SOME TECHNOLOGIES & TOOLS
 # TEAM : DevOps Team
 # CI/CD : Is a methodology / technologies/ tools which helps
 #   from coding to deployment and monitoring
 #--------------------------

 #--------------------------
 # CI/CD tools: Ex: GitLab, Github, jenkins and many more
 #--------------------------
 # We will try to create CI/CD pipeline for our testing
 # Advantage is,
 # if we check in the code, automatically testing will be taken
 # care by GIT Lab CI/CD pipeline
