 Python Libraries
 and
 Complete Python Programming Language Structure
 """

# -------------------------
# Python Libraries
# -------------------------
# Python Libraries can be one module like MyModule.py
# Python Libraries can be one package like MyPackage
# Python Libraries can be Framework where
#   in case of module & package, we are keeping only definitions
#   but
#   in case of framework, not only definitions, it also as
#   some part of code/logic is written
# -------------------------

 # Complete Python Programming Language Structure
 # -------------------------
 # PART - 1 : Python Programming Language
 #           - data types, if, for, while, functions, classes,
 #           - exceptions handling etc
 #       WE CAN DEVELOP FROM SCRATCH
 #
 # PART - 2 : Builtins
 #           - Using PART-1, python communicaty developed
 #           few 1) variables, 2) functions & classes
 #           they are avaialable without import we can use it.
 #           Ex: print, int, float, list, tuple etc
 #
 #           Complete List : print(dir(_builtins_))
 #
 # PART - 3 : Standard Libraries : Some basic libraries are also
 #           installed/copied when we install python
 #           - This we need to import and use
 #           Location : C:\Python310\Lib
 #           Documentation : https://docs.python.org/3/library/
 #
 # PART - 4 : 3rd Party / External Libraries : Remaining all
 #           libraries are maintained in separate REPOSITORY
 #           Location : https://pypi.org/
 #           Documentation : https://pypi.org/
 #
 # PART - 5 : Custom Library - We can develop our own
 #           our library 1) MyModule.py
 #           our library 2) MyPackage
