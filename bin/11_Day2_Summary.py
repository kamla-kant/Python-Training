# Any Program can have
# 1) Variables
# 2) Functions
# 3) Classes (Group of 1) Variables and 2) Functions)

# -------------------------
# Complete Python Programming Language Structure
# -------------------------
# PART - 1 : Python Programming Language
#           - data types, if, for, while, functions, classes,
#           - exceptions handling etc
#       WE CAN DEVELOP FROM SCRATCH
#
# PART - 2 : Builtins
#           - Using PART-1, python communicaty developed
#           few 1) variables, 2) functions & classes
#           they are avaialable without import we can use it.
#           Ex: print, int, float, list, tuple etc
#
#           Complete List : print(dir(_builtins_))
#
# PART - 3 : Standard Libraries : Some basic libraries are also
#           installed/copied when we install python
#           - This we need to import and use
#           Location : C:\Python310\Lib
#           Documentation : https://docs.python.org/3/library/
#           We tried few libraries,
#           - sqlite3
#
# PART - 4 : 3rd Party / External Libraries : Remaining all
#           libraries are maintained in separate REPOSITORY
#           Location : https://pypi.org/
#           Documentation : https://pypi.org/
#           We tried few libraries,
#           - pandas
#
# PART - 5 : Custom Library - We can develop our own
#           our library 1) MyModule.py
#           our library 2) MyPackage
# -------------------------

# We Know
# -------------------------
# 1. How to write program to process data in files like .txt, .csv, .xlsx, json, xml
# 2. How to write program to communicate with any SQL databases
# 3. How to write program to communicate with any No-SQL databases
# 4. How to write program to pull data from website
# 5. How to use testing framework for unittest
